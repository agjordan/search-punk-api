# Simple search page for BrewDog's PunkAPI
React front-end querying and displaying results from BrewDog's [PunkAPI](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). Text search searches through beer names, descriptions, etc. as implemented by the Punk API. Sliders control min and max ABV, Bitterness and Color respectively.
